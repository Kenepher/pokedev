# Pokedev - Frontend Project

Welcome to **Pokedev**, a playful and educational project developed for the "Semana do Zero ao Programador Contratado" event. This project showcases a fun, Pokémon-inspired interface to introduce and explore different "pokedevs," each representing a different type of developer. It uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create interactive and engaging developer cards.

## Project Overview

Pokedev is a frontend project designed to help users learn basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts. It features developer-themed Pokémon cards, each with unique descriptions representing different stages of a developer's journey.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive Developer Cards:** Display information about each "pokedev" when selected.
- **Pokémon-Style Design:** Inspired by the well-known Pokémon franchise, the project adds a touch of creativity to developer profiles.
- **Responsive Layout:** The page adapts to different screen sizes for an optimal experience on various devices.

### Developer Cards
- **Devchu (#001 - Type: Electric):** A developer who channels frustration with coding errors into solving problems with intense focus.
- **Codevee (#003 - Type: Fire):** Known for its adaptability, this developer evolves with the tools and technologies in the ever-changing world of programming.
- **Psycoder (#022 - Type: Water):** A senior developer with exceptional problem-solving skills, especially when under pressure.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into the following main files and folders:
- **index.html**: The core HTML file that contains the structure of the page.
- **style.css**: The stylesheet responsible for the layout and design of the page.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file handling the interactivity of the developer cards.
- **/src/imagens/**: A folder containing the images for each pokedev.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: To style the project with fonts, layouts, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the pokedev cards.
- **Google Fonts**: The font family 'Poppins' was used to give the site a modern and clean look.
